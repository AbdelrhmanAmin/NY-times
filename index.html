                Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the
                existence of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded
                so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang
                13.8 billion years ago.

              Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of
              the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno
              Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the
              Nobel Prize.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
              waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a
              series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South
              Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions.
              The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie
              Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of
              Stanford.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be
              on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he
              said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he
              said.

              Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
              waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a
              series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South
              Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions.
              The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie
              Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of
              Stanford.

              Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of
              the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno
              Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the
              Nobel Prize.

              “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be
              on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he
              said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he
              said.
